      <p>
        I offer startup advisory services to founders and early-stage startups.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialise in raising capital, but I also give advice and support along the 
        entire raising journey. I've got a particular knack for pitch decks and storytelling, 
        branding and comms, and investor relationship building.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been a founder, product designer, and engineer in the past. I've got an
        eye for communicating complex ideas in a clear and compelling way, and 
        I know what it takes bring together all of the moving parts for a startup raise.
      </p>
      <p>
        At WhyHive (my previous startup), we raised a pre-seed round of $600k from founders of 
        Culture Amp, Linktree and Up Bank, among others. 
      </p>
