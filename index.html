      <p>Hey, I'm Matt</p>
      <img id="me-handshake" src="me-handshake.jpg" alt="Matt Cohen" />
      <p>Nice to meet you 🤝</p>
      <p>I’m a ex-startup founder and software product designer living in Melbourne.
        I offer <a href="advisory/index.html">startup advisory services</a> for early-stage and
        first-time founders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I previously co-founded <a target="_blank" href="https://whyhive.com">WhyHive</a>, an
        easy-to-use data analysis app designed for the everyday person. WhyHive
        was like Canva, but for data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also co-founded
        <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221129022626/https://bloodygoodbins.com/">Bloody Good Bins</a>, a social
        enterprise that sold colourful sanitary bins to get people talking about
        periods and menstrual health. We donated 50% of our profits to charity.
        Bloody Good Bins was like Who Gives A Crap, but with sanitary bins.
